- Check the packages installed: pip freeze
- Activate a Virtual Environment: .\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
- Run the flask application: flask run –debug 
- Initialize and create the migration repository:flask db init
- Create an initial migration: flask db migrate -m “initial migration”
- Apply migration to create the tables: flask db upgrade
